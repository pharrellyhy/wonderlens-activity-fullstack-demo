### B. Activity Overview

**① Brief Description**: The child becomes a "Time Traveler" who journeys through prehistoric eras with a dinosaur. AI describes vivid time periods — a giant jungle, a rumbling volcano, a peaceful lake at sunset — and the child imagines what the dinosaur does in each scene using voice acting. The escalation arc moves from comfortable and familiar to intensely dramatic to calm and peaceful, letting the child experience how the same dinosaur behaves differently depending on when and where it is. The adventure builds an intuitive sense of Change through imaginative play.

**② Educational Purpose (KUD)**:
- **K (Know)**: (1) Dinosaurs had big teeth and powerful legs, (2) dinosaurs lived in many different environments like jungles and near volcanoes, (3) some places are loud and dramatic while others are quiet and peaceful, (4) the same creature can act differently in different settings, (5) long ago the world looked and sounded very different from today
- **U (Understand)**: (1) The world around us is always changing — different times and places create different experiences (Change); (2) how a creature behaves depends on the environment it's in, and understanding change helps us make sense of how the world works
- **D (Do)**: (1) Imagine and voice a dinosaur's actions in different scenarios, (2) describe scenes using dramatic and sensory language, (3) recognize how changing conditions lead to different behaviors

**③ Design Highlight**: The time-machine metaphor transforms a toy dinosaur into a portal to different eras. Instead of teaching dinosaur facts directly, the AI drops the child into vivid, sensory-rich scenes and asks them to voice what the dinosaur does — turning passive knowledge into active storytelling. The escalation from comfortable jungle to dramatic volcano to peaceful sunset lake gives the child an embodied feel for how environments shape behavior, making the IB concept of Change something they experience rather than hear about.

**④ Typical Scenario**: A 2–4-year-old photographs a toy dinosaur on the living room floor. AI gasps at those big teeth and powerful legs, then invites the child to climb into a time machine and travel through history together, voicing what the dinosaur does in each era.

### C. Interaction Flow

> Recommended Tier: T0 (ages 2–4)

#### Step 1: Transition Bridge

**AI says:** (wide-eyed wonder) "WHOA! Look at this dinosaur! Look at those big teeth and those powerful legs! What do you think it felt like to be THIS big?"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) "Big!" / "Scary!" / "So strong!" / roars
2. (Unexpected) "It's my toy!" / "Rawr!" / "I like dinosaurs."
3. (No response) Child looks at the screen or the dinosaur.

**AI follow-up:**

1. (amazed) "SO big! This dinosaur must have been the biggest thing in the whole world! Would you like to go on a time-travel adventure with it?"
2. (warm, playful) "I can see why you love it — it's amazing! Would you like to take your dinosaur on a big adventure through time?"
3. (wait 2s) (gentle) "I bet it felt SO powerful — stomping around with those huge legs! Would you like to travel through time and find out?"

**Screen:** Dinosaur photo centered with a prehistoric glow effect, gentle sparkle highlighting the teeth and legs, soft wonder chime.

#### Step 2: Rule Introduction + Demo

**AI says:** (playful, adventurous) "Okay — we have a TIME MACHINE! I'll take us to a time and place, and YOU tell me what the dinosaur does there. Like this..."

(dramatic demo) "If the dinosaur landed in a candy shop, it might try to eat ALL the lollipops — CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP! See? Easy! Would you like to travel through time?"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) "Yeah!" / "Yes!" / "Let's go!" / nods excitedly
2. (Unexpected) "Dinosaurs eat candy?" / laughs / "CHOMP!"
3. (No response) Child is listening.

**AI follow-up:**

1. (thrilled) "Here we go — WHOOOOSH! First time jump!"
2. (giggling) "CHOMP CHOMP — so silly! Now let's see what the dinosaur REALLY does. First time jump!"
3. (wait 2s) (encouraging) "I say where we land, and you tell me what the dinosaur does. Any answer is great! Here we go — WHOOSH!"

**Screen:** Dinosaur photo with a swirling time-portal animation around it, candy-shop demo illustration briefly flashing, playful whoosh sound effect.

#### Step 3: Multi-Round Interaction

**Round 1 — "Prehistoric Jungle":**

**AI says:** (breathless, adventurous) "WHOOSH — we landed in a GIANT prehistoric jungle! Huge trees tower over us and giant ferns are everywhere! What does the dinosaur do here?"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) "Eats the leaves!" / "Stomps around!" / "Explores!" / "ROAR!"
2. (Unexpected) "I don't know." / "Trees!" / "It's green."
3. (No response) Child looks at the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. (amazed) "YES! Stomping through the giant ferns — STOMP STOMP STOMP! This dinosaur loves the jungle!"
2. (warm, building) "Big tall trees everywhere! I think the dinosaur might stomp through them — STOMP STOMP! What a brave dino!"
3. (wait 2s) (helpful) "Maybe the dinosaur stomps through the big ferns? Or munches on the tall leaves? What do you think?"

**Screen:** Illustration of a dinosaur in a lush prehistoric jungle with towering trees and giant ferns, scene-transition whoosh animation.

**Round 2 — "Rumbling Volcano":**

**AI says:** (dramatic, urgent) "Time jump! A big volcano is rumbling — BOOM BOOM! The ground is shaking under our feet! What does the dinosaur do?"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) "Runs away!" / "ROAR!" / "It's scared!" / "Hides!"
2. (Unexpected) "Boom!" / "Hot!" / "Fire!" / laughs nervously
3. (No response) Child watches the screen.

**AI follow-up:**

1. (thrilled) "RUN, dinosaur, RUN! Those powerful legs are SO fast — zoom, away from the volcano!"
2. (playful, dramatic) "BOOM BOOM — so loud! I think the dinosaur uses those powerful legs to run really fast! Zoom!"
3. (wait 2s) (encouraging) "The ground is shaking — BOOM! Maybe the dinosaur runs really fast with those big legs? What do you think?"

**Screen:** Illustration of a dinosaur near a rumbling volcano with orange lava glow and shaking ground lines, dramatic scene-transition animation.

**Round 3 — "Peaceful Lake":**

**AI says:** (soft, calm) "Last time jump! A beautiful lake at sunset. Everything is golden and calm. Birds are singing softly... What does the dinosaur do now?"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) "Drinks water!" / "Sleeps!" / "Rests!" / "Swims!"
2. (Unexpected) "Pretty!" / "I see birds." / "Shh!" / whispers
3. (No response) Child is quiet, maybe relaxed.

**AI follow-up:**

1. (warm, peaceful) "Ahhh, resting by the golden water. What a peaceful dinosaur. This is the perfect spot after all that adventure."
2. (gentle) "So pretty and calm. I think the dinosaur sits down by the water and watches the sunset. So peaceful."
3. (wait 2s) (soothing) "Everything is so quiet and golden. Maybe the dinosaur takes a big drink of water and rests. What a calm, happy dino."

**Screen:** Illustration of a dinosaur resting by a peaceful lake at sunset with golden light and soft reflections, gentle pulse animation, soft celebration fanfare.

#### Step 4: Celebration

**AI says:** (proud, triumphant) "WOW! You explored a giant jungle, braved a rumbling volcano, and found peace by a golden lake! You are officially a... Time Traveler! What an amazing adventure!"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) "Yay!" / "I'm a Time Traveler!" / cheers or claps
2. (Unexpected) "Again!" / "More dinosaurs!" / "I liked the volcano!"
3. (No response) Child smiles or looks at the badge.

**AI follow-up:**

1. (beaming) "The bravest Time Traveler! This dinosaur is so lucky to have explored with you!"
2. (delighted) "The volcano was SO exciting! You were brave through the whole adventure, Time Traveler!"
3. (wait 2s) (warm) "You did it! Three time jumps, three adventures — you're an amazing Time Traveler!"

**Screen:** Animated "Time Traveler" badge with a dinosaur silhouette and clock icon, the child's dinosaur photo inset, golden stars and celebration chime, all three time-jump scenes shown as small stamps.

#### Step 5: Closing + IB Concepts

**AI says:** (warm, reflective) "You know what's really cool? The same dinosaur did something different every single time! In the jungle it explored, at the volcano it was brave, and at the lake it was peaceful. Things change depending on where you are and what's happening around you. That's called Change!"

**Child responses:**

1. (Ideal) "Change!" / "The dinosaur changed!" / nods or smiles
2. (Unexpected) "What's Change?" / "I liked when it ran!" / "Bye, dinosaur!"

**AI follow-up:**

1. (celebrating) "Yes — Change! And now you'll see it everywhere. See you on the next adventure, Time Traveler!"
2. (warm, clear) "Change means things are different at different times and places — just like your dinosaur! See you next time, Time Traveler!"

**Screen:** "Change" in colorful prehistoric-themed lettering with a timeline showing jungle, volcano, and lake icons connected by arrows; Time Traveler badge in the corner with dinosaur photo glowing behind.
